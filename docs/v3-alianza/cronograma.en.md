# 📘 PART VII — AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

The implementation of the Piregal–Herculan agreement must be fast, disciplined, and visible from the first month. The naval sector does not wait, shipyards do not wait, and neither does the competition. Therefore, the timeline is structured into four tactical phases designed to activate the alliance, consolidate it, and project it toward 2027 with a dominant position.

This timeline is not a decorative calendar: it is the roadmap that turns the alliance into an immediate operational reality, with measurable milestones and clear consequences.

### PHASE 1 — FOUNDATION AND SHIELDING (Months 1–2)
**Objective:** Activate the alliance and shield the operational structure.

* **Milestone 01 — Final Signing of Agreement and Operational Documents:** Signing of NDA, PMEE, PSAH, and Operational Project Protocol. The alliance is legally shielded and operationally defined.
* **Milestone 02 — Vigo Hub Activation:** Reception of the first critical stock (SL 400, SL 500, primers, additives). Setup of the automatic replenishment system. 24/48h response capacity from the first month.
* **Milestone 03 — “Herculan Certified” Training in Meerkerk:** Management and middle management training. Initial technical team certification. Piregal speaks the “factory language” and operates with technical authority.

**Phase Objective:** To be 100% operational before the end of the second month.

### PHASE 2 — NAVAL OFFENSIVE AND SPECIFICATION (Months 3–5)
**Objective:** Attack the naval cluster and displace Teak as the standard.

* **Milestone 04 — Strategic Substitution Campaign in Northwest Shipyards:** Presentation of the Closed-Loop Warranty model. Technical comparisons against Teak and non-aliphatic resins. Opening the pipeline in key shipyards.
* **Milestone 05 — Digital Audit Protocol Implementation:** Laser scanning, moisture testing, and Non-Conformance Reports (NCR). Piregal positions itself as a technical auditor, not just a trade.
* **Milestone 06 — First PSAH Quarterly Audit:** Real KPIs and immediate corrections. Validation of PMEE progress.

**Phase Objective:** Capture at least 3 exterior deck projects by displacing Teak.

### PHASE 3 — CIVIL DIVERSIFICATION AND CONSOLIDATION (Months 6–9)
**Objective:** Transfer naval authority to the healthcare and education sectors.

* **Milestone 07 — Commercial Deployment in Healthcare Sector:** Presentation of SL 400 to hospital groups. Prior audits as a specification tool. Opening the pipeline in two hospital groups.
* **Milestone 08 — 100% Operational Staff Certification:** Advanced training and technical evaluation. The entire team operates under the Herculan standard.
* **Milestone 09 — PSAH Bi-annual Review:** Analysis of margins, volume pricing, and new territories. Strategic adjustment to maintain competitive advantage.

**Phase Objective:** Ensure that 80% of issued quotes are under the Herculan closed system.

### PHASE 4 — DOMINANCE AND 2027 PLANNING (Months 10–12)
**Objective:** Consolidate the dominant position and prepare for international expansion.

* **Milestone 10 — Success Case Presentation at International Fairs:** Naval refit and healthcare projects. International positioning of the alliance.
* **Milestone 11 — PMEE Review for Mediterranean Expansion:** Planning for Southern France, Italy, and Morocco. International expansion plan for 2027.
* **Milestone 12 — Customer Satisfaction Audit:** Captains, owners, and site managers. External validation of the model.

**Phase Objective:** Consolidate Piregal as the undisputed leader in technical specification for luxury resins on the Peninsula.

### SUCCESS KPIs 2026
* **70% specification rate** in projects where Herculan is specified at the source.
* **40% reduction** in startup times thanks to the Vigo Hub.
* **0% technical incidents** due to the prior audit protocol.
* **100% transparency:** 0 contracts lost due to lack of transparency or compliance.
