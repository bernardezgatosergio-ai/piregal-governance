📘 PART V — PSAH: SYNCHRONY AND MILESTONE AUDIT PROTOCOL (English)
The Synchrony and Milestone Audit Protocol (PSAH) is the system that ensures the Piregal–Herculan alliance operates with surgical precision [cite: 2026-02-18]. While the PMEE defines the course, the PSAH is the mechanism that ensures we do not deviate by a single millimeter, eliminating improvisation and lack of follow-up [cite: 2026-02-18].

1. PHASE 1 — OPERATIONAL SYNCHRONY (MONTHLY REVIEW)
Objective: Absolute control over daily operations [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is the operational pulse where deviations are detected before they become problems [cite: 2026-02-18].

Key Actions:

Vigo Hub Critical Stock Review: No out-of-stock allowed for SL 400, SL 500, primers, and additives [cite: 2026-02-18].

Technical Project Monitoring: Control of incidents, curing times, and critical windows [cite: 2026-02-18].

30-Day Coordination: Advance planning to ensure immediate availability [cite: 2026-02-18].

Incident Resolution: Problems must be resolved within the month or escalated immediately [cite: 2026-02-18].

2. PHASE 2 — MILESTONE AUDIT (QUARTERLY REVIEW)
Objective: Validate real PMEE progress [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is the mechanism that prevents the alliance from becoming complacent or losing focus [cite: 2026-02-18].

Key Actions:

KPI Analysis: Applied square meters, tender success ratio, and response times [cite: 2026-02-18].

Specification Report: Verification of whether we are imposing the Herculan standard at the source [cite: 2026-02-18].

Herculan Certification: Checking progress toward 100% certified personnel [cite: 2026-02-18].

Brand Commitment: Evaluation of the “Herculan by default” approach and detection of external pressures [cite: 2026-02-18].

3. PHASE 3 — STRATEGY ADJUSTMENT (BI-ANNUAL REVIEW)
Objective: Adapt to the market and maintain competitive advantage [cite: 2026-02-18].

Key Actions:

Market Share Analysis: Evaluation of ground gained against direct competitors [cite: 2026-02-18].

Margin Review: Adjustments of volume pricing, territory, or project type [cite: 2026-02-18].

New Niches: Identification of opportunities in the Mediterranean, international refit, or civil projects [cite: 2026-02-18].

PMEE Update: Rewriting the master plan based on changing market realities [cite: 2026-02-18].

4. PSAH AS A TOTAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The PSAH is not a meeting calendar; it is a governance system that detects deviations, mandates corrections, and protects the Operational Symbiosis [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is the difference between a symbolic alliance and an invincible one [cite: 2026-02-18].
