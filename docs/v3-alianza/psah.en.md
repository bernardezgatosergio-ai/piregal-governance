# 📘 PART V — PSAH: SYNCHRONY AND MILESTONE AUDIT PROTOCOL

The Synchrony and Milestone Audit Protocol (PSAH) is the system that guarantees the Piregal–Herculan alliance functions with surgical precision [cite: 2026-02-18]. If the PMEE defines the course, the PSAH is the mechanism that ensures we do not deviate by a single millimeter, eliminating improvisation and lack of follow-up [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 1. PHASE 1 — OPERATIONAL SYNCHRONY (MONTHLY REVIEW)
**Objective:** Absolute control of day-to-day operations [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is the operational pulse where deviations are detected before they become problems [cite: 2026-02-18].

**Key actions:**
* **Vigo Hub Critical Stock Review:** Stockouts are prohibited for SL 400, SL 500, primers, and additives [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Technical Project Monitoring:** Control of incidents, curing times, and critical windows [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **30-Day Coordination:** Advance planning to guarantee immediate availability [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Incident Resolution:** Problems are resolved within the month or escalated immediately [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 2. PHASE 2 — MILESTONE AUDIT (QUARTERLY REVIEW)
**Objective:** Validate the actual progress of the PMEE [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is the mechanism that prevents the alliance from relaxing or losing focus [cite: 2026-02-18].

**Key actions:**
* **KPI Analysis:** Applied square meters, tender success ratio, and response times [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Specification Report:** Verification of whether we are imposing the Herculan standard at the source [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Herculan Certification:** Verifying progress toward 100% certified personnel [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Brand Commitment:** Evaluation of the “Herculan by default” approach and detection of external pressures [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 3. PHASE 3 — STRATEGY ADJUSTMENT (SEMI-ANNUAL REVIEW)
**Objective:** Adapt to the market and maintain competitive advantage [cite: 2026-02-18].

**Key actions:**
* **Market Share Analysis:** Evaluation of ground gained against direct competitors [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Margin Review:** Price adjustments based on volume, territory, or project type [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **New Niches:** Identification of opportunities in the Mediterranean, international refit, or civil projects [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **PMEE Update:** Rewriting the master plan according to the changing market reality [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 4. PSAH AS A TOTAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The PSAH is not a meeting calendar; it is a governance system that detects deviations, forces corrections, and protects Operational Symbiosis [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is the difference between a symbolic alliance and an invincible one [cite: 2026-02-18].
