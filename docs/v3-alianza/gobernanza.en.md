📘 PART III — COMMON GOVERNANCE PROJECT (English)
The Piregal–Herculan alliance cannot rely on goodwill or operational improvisation [cite: 2026-02-18]. For Operational Symbiosis to be real, it is essential to establish a governance system that turns this collaboration into a stable, measurable, and controlled structure [cite: 2026-02-18].

1. THE MASTER DOCUMENT: PMEE
The PMEE (Strategic Expansion Master Plan) is the operational bible of the alliance [cite: 2026-02-18]. It defines how Piregal and Herculan will tackle the Iberian and European markets as a single engine, establishing [cite: 2026-02-18]:

Technical specification methodology [cite: 2026-02-18].

The logistical and operational structure of the Vigo Hub [cite: 2026-02-18].

The joint quality, certification, and warranty model [cite: 2026-02-18].

The tactical schedule until 2026 [cite: 2026-02-18].

2. THE CONTROL PROCEDURE: PSAH
The PSAH (Synchrony and Milestone Audit Protocol) is the engine that keeps the alliance alive through three layers of control [cite: 2026-02-18]:

2.1. Operational Synchrony (Monthly): Daily control, critical stock in Vigo, and immediate incident resolution [cite: 2026-02-18].

2.2. Milestone Audit (Quarterly): Evaluation of PMEE compliance, applied square meter KPIs, and staff certification [cite: 2026-02-18].

2.3. Strategy Adjustment (Bi-annually): Review of exclusivity, margins, volume pricing, and new territories [cite: 2026-02-18].

3. OPERATING AS A SINGLE COMPANY
Governance dictates that Piregal and Herculan do not operate as supplier and client, but as an integrated system involving [cite: 2026-02-18]:

A single technical standard and commercial discourse [cite: 2026-02-18].

A single system for quality, auditing, and joint warranty [cite: 2026-02-18].

A single project pipeline and reporting system [cite: 2026-02-18].

4. OFFICIAL NOMENCLATURE
To avoid deviations, the mandatory use of the following terms is established: PMEE, PSAH, Operational Symbiosis, Ethical Shield, and Vigo Hub [cite: 2026-02-18]. This nomenclature is the basis for operating with surgical precision [cite: 2026-02-18].
