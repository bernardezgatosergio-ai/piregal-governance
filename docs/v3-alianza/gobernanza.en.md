# 📘 PART III — COMMON GOVERNANCE PROJECT

The **Piregal–Herculan** alliance cannot depend on goodwill or operational improvisation [cite: 2026-02-18]. For **Operational Symbiosis** to be real, it is essential to establish a governance system that turns this collaboration into a stable, measurable, and controlled structure [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 1. THE MASTER DOCUMENT: PMEE
The **PMEE (Strategic Expansion Master Plan)** is the operational bible of the alliance [cite: 2026-02-18]. It defines how Piregal and Herculan will tackle the Iberian and European markets as a single engine, establishing [cite: 2026-02-18]:
* Technical specification methodology.
* The logistical and operational structure of the **Vigo Hub**.
* The model for quality, certification, and joint warranty.
* The tactical schedule through 2026.

### 2. THE CONTROL PROCEDURE: PSAH
The **PSAH (Synchrony and Milestone Audit Protocol)** is the engine that keeps the alliance alive through three layers of control [cite: 2026-02-18]:
* **2.1. Operational Synchrony (Monthly):** Day-to-day control, critical stock in Vigo, and immediate incident resolution.
* **2.2. Milestone Audit (Quarterly):** Evaluation of PMEE compliance, applied square meter KPIs, and staff certification.
* **2.3. Strategic Adjustment (Biannual):** Review of exclusivity, margins, volume pricing, and new territories.

### 3. OPERATING AS A SINGLE COMPANY
Governance establishes that Piregal and Herculan do not operate as supplier and client, but as an integrated system involving [cite: 2026-02-18]:
* A single technical standard and commercial discourse.
* A single quality, audit, and joint warranty system.
* A single project pipeline and reporting system.

### 4. OFFICIAL NOMENCLATURE
To avoid deviations, the mandatory use of the following terms is established: **PMEE, PSAH, Operational Symbiosis, Ethical Shield, and Vigo Hub** [cite: 2026-02-18]. This nomenclature is the basis for operating with surgical precision.
