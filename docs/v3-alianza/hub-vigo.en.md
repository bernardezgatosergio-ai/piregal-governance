# 📎 APPENDIX V — VIGO HUB OPERATIONAL SCHEME

The Vigo Hub is not a warehouse. It is a strategic infrastructure designed to turn Piregal into Herculan's rapid intervention team in the Iberian Peninsula and the gateway to the Mediterranean. Its function is to eliminate downtime, guarantee immediate availability, and allow surgical execution where time is a risk factor.

### 1. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
* **24/48h Response:** Start projects or urgent repairs without depending on the 10–12 day transit time from the Netherlands.
* **Logistical Shielding:** No other installer in Spain matches this operational capacity.
* **Risk Reduction:** Elimination of delays due to customs, transport strikes, or stockouts.
* **International Base:** Logistical platform for projects in Southern France, Portugal, and Morocco.

### 2. HUB OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE
The Hub is divided into four critical areas to maximize speed:
* **Area A — Critical Stock:** Naval Systems (SL 500 Aliphatic/Eco Teak), Healthcare Systems (SL 400/300), Primers, and additives. Minimum level: stock for two complete projects of each system.
* **Area B — Tinting & Color:** Spectrophotometer and mixing system for total chromatic autonomy. Sample creation in hours and on-site color adjustments for superyachts.
* **Area C — Machinery:** Mandatory inventory of mixers, industrial vacuums, and calibrated scales. Golden rule: mandatory duplication of all critical equipment.
* **Area D — International Logistics:** Preparation of export kits with reinforced packaging and batch control for projects outside Spain.

### 3. TACTICAL OPERATIONAL FLOW
1. **Reception:** Batch verification, digital registration, and visual quality control.
2. **Kit Preparation:** An "Intervention Kit" is prepared for each project (Materials + Tools + Preconfigured ITP).
3. **Mobilization:** Target time: less than 2 hours from official request.
4. **Automatic Replenishment:** Based on monthly PSAH and the project pipeline. The system generates an automatic order to Herculan when stock falls below the minimum.

### 4. PROTOCOLS AND KPIs
* **Emergency Protocol:** Immediate mobilization for unexpected shipyard windows or urgent NCRs.
* **Export Protocol:** Reinforced packaging and GPS tracking for international shipments.
* **Success KPIs:** Response time < 48h, Stockouts 0%, Full traceability 100%.

### 5. STRATEGIC BENEFITS
It eliminates logistical dependence on the manufacturer, increases commercial closing rates, and positions the alliance as the only reliable option in the luxury naval sector.
