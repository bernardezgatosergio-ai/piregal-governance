# 📘 PART IV — PMEE: STRATEGIC EXPANSION MASTER PLAN

The Strategic Expansion Master Plan (PMEE) is the operating system that defines how Piregal and Herculan will regain ground, impose a new technical standard, and shield their position in the naval, civil, and industrial sectors through 2026 [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 1. PHILOSOPHICAL AND BUSINESS FRAMEWORK
This alliance exists to reverse the loss of competitiveness in the European naval sector, proving that technical excellence is profitable [cite: 2026-02-18].

* **1.1. Reference Installer:** Piregal positions itself as the sole interlocutor in high-technical-risk projects [cite: 2026-02-18]. Herculan waives support for other applicators within the Spanish naval cluster, and the installer's margin is fully respected [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **1.2. The “Armed Wing”:** Surgical efficiency amidst operational chaos [cite: 2026-02-18]. We strategically replace Teak to save time (eliminating 3-week delays) and act as a strike team with a closed-loop warranty [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **1.3. The “Ethical Shield”:** Integrity based on total cost transparency, adherence to international standards (Bfl-S1, UV stability), and the alliance's real accountability for failures [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 2. TACTICAL OPERATIONAL ACTIONS
* **Critical Window Protocol:** Operational speed as the primary commercial argument [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Certified Single Warranty:** Factory-sealed certificate provided from the contract signing [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Prior Technical Audit:** Laser scanning, moisture testing, and issuance of a Non-Conformity Report (NCR) if the substrate fails to comply [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **“Open Book” Transparency:** Full cost disclosure on VIP projects to eliminate commission suspicions [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 3. CLUSTER ANALYSIS
* **Naval Sector:** Turning the SL 500 series into the standard for smart luxury, displacing Teak through aesthetics, speed, and UV durability [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Civil & Industrial Sector:** Entry into critical infrastructure with SL 400 (Healthcare) and SL 300 (Education/Commercial) [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 4. INFRASTRUCTURE: VIGO HUB
The Vigo Hub is not a warehouse; it is the competitive advantage: permanent critical stock (SL 400/500), local tinting capacity, and a 24/48h technical response for unforeseen project windows [cite: 2026-02-18].
