📘 PART IV — PMEE: STRATEGIC EXPANSION MASTER PLAN (English)
The Strategic Expansion Master Plan (PMEE) is the operating system that defines how Piregal and Herculan will regain ground, impose a new technical standard, and shield their position in the naval, civil, and industrial sectors until 2026 [cite: 2026-02-18].

1. Philosophical and Business Framework
This alliance exists to reverse the loss of competitiveness in the European naval sector, proving that technical excellence is profitable [cite: 2026-02-18].

1.1. Reference Installer: Piregal is positioned as the sole point of contact for high technical risk projects [cite: 2026-02-18]. Herculan explicitly waives support for other applicators in the Spanish naval cluster, and the installer's margin is fully protected [cite: 2026-02-18].

1.2. The “Armed Arm”: Surgical efficiency against operational chaos [cite: 2026-02-18]. Strategic Teak replacement to save time (eliminating 3 weeks of delay) and acting as a strike team with closed-loop warranty [cite: 2026-02-18].

1.3. The “Ethical Shield”: Integrity based on total cost transparency, use of international standards (Bfl-S1, UV stability), and real alliance responsibility in case of failures [cite: 2026-02-18].

2. Operational Shock Actions
Critical Window Protocol: Operational speed as the primary commercial argument [cite: 2026-02-18].

Certified Unique Warranty: Factory-sealed warranty certificate from the moment the contract is signed [cite: 2026-02-18].

Prior Technical Audit: Laser scanning, moisture testing, and issuance of Non-Conformance (NCR) if the substrate does not comply [cite: 2026-02-18].

“Open Book” Transparency: Cost transparency in VIP projects to eliminate suspicions of commissions [cite: 2026-02-18].

3. Cluster Analysis
Naval Sector: Turning the SL 500 series into the standard for intelligent luxury, displacing Teak through aesthetics, speed, and UV durability [cite: 2026-02-18].

Civil and Industrial Sector: Entering critical infrastructure with SL 400 (Healthcare) and SL 300 (Education/Commercial) [cite: 2026-02-18].

4. Infrastructure: Vigo Hub
The Vigo Hub is not a warehouse; it is the competitive advantage: permanent critical stock (SL 400/500), local tinting capacity, and 24/48h technical response to unforeseen windows [cite: 2026-02-18].
