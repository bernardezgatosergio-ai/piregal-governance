# 📘 APPENDIX VII — COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES WITH SHIPYARDS

Communication with shipyards is a high-risk area. A poorly phrased message or a verbal instruction can trigger contractual conflicts, loss of warranty, or unjustified claims. The **Piregal–Herculan** alliance establishes a formal, traceable, and shielded communication system that eliminates improvisation [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 1. COMMUNICATION PRINCIPLES
* **Single Point of Contact:** Only the Piregal Site Manager communicates officially with the shipyard to prevent contradictory orders [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Mandatory Documentation:** Verbal orders are not accepted. All instructions must be recorded in the Daily Project Log and ITP [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Technical Tone:** No conflicts; everything is documented to protect technical integrity and warranty [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 2. NOTICE OF READINESS (NOR) - Acceptance Report
Document certifying the area is ready. No application begins without a signed NOR [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Effect:** Transfers environmental responsibility to the shipyard. If the substrate changes or is damaged after the NOR, the shipyard is liable [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 3. NOTICE OF DELAY (NOD) - Delay Record
The NOD is the contractual tool against external interferences (other trades, weather, lack of ventilation) [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Effect:** The delay is no longer the alliance's responsibility, protecting deadlines, costs, and warranty [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 4. INTERFERENCE AND HANDOVER PROTOCOLS
* **Interference:** If another trade invades the area, application stops, photos are taken, and an NCR or NOD is issued [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Handover:** Requires joint inspection and delivery of the full ITP, closed NCRs, and Warranty Certificate. Without a signed acceptance, the project is not considered delivered [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 5. AFTER-SALES PROTOCOL
**24/48h** response activated from the Vigo Hub. Every incident must be documented, classified, and technically evaluated with Herculan's validation [cite: 2026-02-18].
