# ⚠️ NON-CONFORMANCE REPORT (NCR) PROTOCOL

The NCR is Piregal’s **technical defense** mechanism. Its objective is to record any deviation from Herculan standards to protect the alliance’s warranty and reputation [cite: 2026-02-18].

## 1. NCR Activation
An NCR must be opened immediately if any of the following conditions are detected:
* **Environmental Failure:** Humidity >80% or substrate temperature <3°C above the dew point [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Contamination:** Presence of dust, grease, or oils after final cleaning [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Mixing Error:** Deviation in resin weighing or incorrect induction time [cite: 2026-02-18].

## 2. Severity Levels
* **🔴 Level 1 (Critical):** Immediate technical halt. Requires authorization from the Site Manager to resume [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **🟡 Level 2 (Important):** Corrective action required before applying the next layer [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **🔵 Level 3 (Informative):** Damage caused by third parties that must be recorded to define responsibilities [cite: 2026-02-18].

## 3. Resolution and Closure
No project can be delivered with an open NCR. Each record must include:
1. **Photographic Evidence** of the issue [cite: 2026-02-18].
2. **Corrective Action** executed (e.g., re-sanding, forced drying) [cite: 2026-02-18].
3. **Final Validation** via digital ITP [cite: 2026-02-18].
