# 📘 PART VI — OPERATIONAL PROJECT PROTOCOL

The Operational Project Protocol is the tool that ensures every intervention executed under the Piregal–Herculan alliance is a surgical operation: predictable, traceable, auditable, and legally shielded. In a sector where improvisation is the norm and errors are costly, this protocol sets a standard that admits no deviations. It describes what is correct, not "what is common."

### 1. LOGISTICS, MOBILITY, AND STAFF MANAGEMENT
Logistics is part of quality. A delay, poorly housed team, or missing tool backup can compromise an entire project. The alliance establishes a professionalized mobility model, worthy of an elite technical intervention team.

* **Team Mobility:** Vehicles differentiated by type (technical vans for intervention and executive vehicles for meetings). Mandatory GPS tracking to optimize routes and coordination. International travel protocols for strategic projects (France, Italy, Morocco).
* **Accommodation and Well-being:** Overnight standards defined by distance to the site and rest conditions to ensure performance during continuous application days and critical windows.
* **Insurance and Permits:** Management of port passes, professional cards (DPA, ISPS), and restricted access. Verification of specific Liability Insurance for high-value assets (superyachts, hospitals).

### 2. PREPARATION, SCENARIO, AND PROTECTION (THE SHIP'S SHIELD)
In the naval sector, the environment is as critical as the product. Preparation is an act of audit, not a formality.

* **Entry Audit and “Notice of Readiness”:** Area reception report signed with the shipyard. Confirmation of an area free of dust, moisture, and interference. Photographic documentation of prior damage to avoid false claims.
* **Luxury Perimeter Protection:** Professional masking and watertight sealing of sensitive areas (wood, steel, upholstery, electronics). Installation of forced extraction in confined areas.
* **Surgical Substrate Preparation:** Technical selection of abrasives (shot blasting, milling, or diamond) according to substrate. Final cleaning with industrial vacuuming and specific Herculan solvents.
* **Precision Environmental Control:** Continuous monitoring with data loggers (wet bulb, dew point, surface temperature). Absolute prohibition of application if +3°C above the dew point is not met.

### 3. TOOLS, EQUIPMENT, AND REDUNDANCY
On a superyacht, a broken mixer is a contractual disaster. We establish a model of critical redundancy.

* **“Level 0” Tool Kit:** Double-helix mixers, calibrated trowels, nylon spiked aerating rollers, and high-precision digital scales with mandatory calibration.
* **Critical Redundancy:** Mandatory duplication of essential machinery (mixers, vacuums, extraction systems). Immediate replacement protocol in case of breakdown.
* **Maintenance:** Immediate cleaning with authorized solvents. Dirty tools are grounds for immediate technical sanction.

### 4. QUALITY MONITORING AND DIGITAL TRACEABILITY (ITP)
Traceability is a contractual weapon to prove the alliance did the right thing.

* **Batch Inspection:** Recording of batch numbers for each drum, linked exactly to the area of the ship where it was applied.
* **Layer and Timing Control:** Marking re-coating times to guarantee chemical adhesion. Micron measurement in wet and dry states (ultrasonic on metal substrates).
* **Cloud Project Diary:** Daily photographic report with shared access for Herculan and the final client. Documentary evidence for any dispute.

### 5. STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SHIPYARD
Piregal acts as a technical authority, not as a subordinate trade.

* **Single Interlocution:** The Piregal Site Manager is the sole contact for the shipyard Project Manager to eliminate conflicting orders.
* **“Notice of Delay” Protocol:** Immediate issuance of an official document if another trade invades the area or if environmental conditions are unfit. Transfers responsibility for the delay to the shipyard.
* **Waste Management:** Removal of packaging and chemical waste according to MARPOL regulations and local legislation.
