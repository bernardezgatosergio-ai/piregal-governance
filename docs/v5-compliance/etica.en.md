# 📘 PART VIII — COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK AND OPERATIONAL ETHICS

The naval and civil sectors in Spain and Europe have normalized practices that erode trust, distort prices, and destroy competitiveness: undisclosed commissions, intermediaries with no real function, manipulated specifications, and untrained installers. The **Piregal–Herculan** alliance was born to break this model. Compliance is not a legal requirement: it is a survival and differentiation strategy.

### 1. PRINCIPLE OF RADICAL TRANSPARENCY
The alliance adopts a total transparency model regarding price structure, material costs, margins, warranty conditions, and technical audit processes.
* **Open Book Protocol:** In VIP or high-sensitivity projects, the client can audit the real cost structure of the material versus the application price.
* **Objective:** To eliminate suspicion, block opaque commissions, and generate absolute loyalty with captains, owners, and Owner’s Representatives.

### 2. PROHIBITION OF OPAQUE COMMISSIONS
The alliance expressly prohibits undisclosed commissions, payments to intermediaries without technical function, and incentives that alter technical specifications.
* **Controlled Exception (“Necessary Commission”):** Only allowed in exceptional cases, always managed by Piregal, communicated to Herculan, integrated into the official offer, and duly justified.
* **Objective:** To prevent third parties from distorting the project or blocking the alliance’s entry.

### 3. JOINT LIABILITY AS A COMPLIANCE MECHANISM
The joint Herculan–Piregal warranty is more than a commercial argument; it is a compliance mechanism. By assuming joint liability:
* The possibility of cross-blaming is eliminated.
* Both parties are forced to maintain maximum standards.
* The final client is protected from negligent practices, and the entry of installers lacking rigor is prevented.

### 4. TECHNICAL AUDIT AS AN ETHICAL BARRIER
The prior audit (laser scanning, moisture testing, suitability report) is a compliance tool that allows:
* Documenting the real state of the substrate and preventing the shipyard from forcing applications outside of required conditions.
* Issuing Non-Conformance Reports (NCR) that protect the warranty and prevent false or manipulated claims.
* The audit turns Piregal into an **auditor**, not a laborer.

### 5. MANDATORY DIGITAL TRACEABILITY
Each project must generate a digital file containing material batches, environmental conditions, photographs of each layer, re-coating times, NCR reports, and entry/exit logs.
* This file serves as documentary evidence in disputes, proof of regulatory compliance, and a legal weapon against installers who lack technical rigor.

### 6. PROTECTION OF TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
* Piregal will not specify alternative brands.
* Herculan will not support other installers in the Spanish naval cluster.
* Any attempt by third parties to manipulate the specification will be documented and blocked through normative comparisons (Bfl-S1, Aliphatic UV, TUV Premium).
