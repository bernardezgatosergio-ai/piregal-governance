# 📘 PIREGAL WORKER'S MANUAL
**Responsibility, Excellence, and High-Performance Culture**

### 1. WHO YOU ARE WITHIN PIREGAL
Piregal is not a conventional application company. It is an **elite technical team** operating in projects where quality is visible, traceability is mandatory, and reputation is built daily [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 2. YOUR INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
* **Absolute Technical Rigor:** Measuring correctly, documenting every step, and following protocols without exception. A technical error is not just a mistake: it is a breach of the Piregal standard [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Mandatory Documentation:** If it is not documented, it does not exist. It is mandatory to record photographs, environmental readings, batches, timings, and incidents [cite: 2026-02-18].

* **On the Company:** Your precision reduces costs, increases margins, and strengthens our strategic position [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **On your Future:** This manual is the basis for your **evaluation, variable pay, incentives**, and professional progression within the alliance [cite: 2026-02-18].
