# 📘 PART II — NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA)

This Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the legal and operational foundation of the strategic alliance between **Herculan B.V.** and **Piregal S.L.** [cite: 2026-02-18]. Its purpose is to protect the exchange of critical information, allowing both organizations to operate as a single technical and commercial system, ensuring the integrity of the **Operational Symbiosis** model and shielding the alliance's competitive advantage [cite: 2026-02-18].

This agreement is not an administrative formality: it is the protective mechanism that prevents shared knowledge from being used to reconstruct the toxic model that the alliance aims to replace [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 1. OBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT
Both parties acknowledge that joint expansion requires sharing highly sensitive information, including [cite: 2026-02-18]:
* **Chemical formulas** and technical developments.
* **Pricing strategies** and margins.
* **Customer and specifier databases**.
* **Audit protocols**, environmental control, and traceability.
* **Application methodologies** and operational know-how.
* **Commercial, logistical, and positioning strategies**.

All this information constitutes an essential strategic asset that must be protected with the utmost rigor [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 2. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Confidential Information is considered any data explicitly marked as such or which, by its nature, should be understood as such, including bidding strategies, **Non-Conformance Reports (NCR)**, material performance data, and operational information from the **Vigo Hub** [cite: 2026-02-18]. Confidentiality extends to all media: verbal, written, digital, and operational [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 3. USE OF INFORMATION
Shared information may only be used for the development and execution of Operational Symbiosis, the **PMEE**, and the **PSAH** [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is strictly forbidden to use information for unilateral benefit, to compete internally or externally with the other party, or to transfer data to third parties without express authorization [cite: 2026-02-18]. **Information is not shared to compete, but to integrate** [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 4. DURATION OF THE COMMITMENT
The confidentiality obligation shall remain in effect for a minimum of **five (5) years** from the signing of the agreement, regardless of whether the commercial relationship continues [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 5. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATIONAL SYMBIOSIS
The NDA is based on four mandatory principles of conduct [cite: 2026-02-18]:
* **5.1. Total Trust:** Herculan recognizes Piregal's commercial sovereignty in Spain; Piregal recognizes Herculan's technical authority.
* **5.2. Network Respect:** Herculan will not make direct sales in the Spanish naval cluster without Piregal's involvement.
* **5.3. Transparency in Quality:** Honest reporting of field performance for formula improvement.
* **5.4. Long-Term Vision:** Joint reputation prevails over immediate profit.

### 6. MEDIATION AND TECHNICAL ARBITRATION PROTOCOL
* **6.1. Direct Mediation:** Meeting between management within a maximum of 10 days following a discrepancy.
* **6.2. Technical Arbitration:** In technical disputes, an independent expert report will issue a binding decision.
* **6.3. Good Faith Clause:** Obligation to exhaust these routes before any legal action.

### 7. SCOPE AND EFFECTS
Breach of the NDA constitutes a serious violation that triggers the mediation protocol, suspension of collaboration, and claims for damages [cite: 2026-02-18].
