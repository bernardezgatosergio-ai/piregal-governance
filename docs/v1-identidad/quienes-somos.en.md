# 👥 WHO WE ARE: THE TECHNICAL CONFLUENCE

The alliance between **Piregal** and **Herculan B.V.** is not a conventional commercial agreement; it is the integration of two paths of excellence aimed at correcting the deficiencies of a fragmented sector.

### 🌲 Piregal: Engineering and Execution
Piregal provides technical reliability and deep knowledge of execution in industrial and naval projects. With a heritage linked to the precision of the timber industry and cutting-edge engineering, we represent the figure of the **Elite Installer**: one who does not merely apply a product, but audits the environment, controls traceability, and assumes full responsibility for the final result.

### 🧪 Herculan B.V.: Chemical Innovation and Manufacturing
Based in the Netherlands, Herculan B.V. represents the pinnacle of innovation in resin systems and synthetic flooring. As a leading manufacturer, their value lies not only in the quality of their chemistry but in their commitment to avoiding the parasitization of the sales channel, directly supporting the applicator with real technical support and continuous training.

### 🛡️ The Differential Value
What defines us is not what we sell, but how we operate:

1.  **Single Point of Responsibility:** We eliminate the conflict between manufacturer and installer. We stand as a single interlocutor for the client.
2.  **Zero Opacity:** We do not participate in the network of commissions that degrades the European market. Our competitiveness stems from efficiency, not "favors."
3.  **Naval Excellence:** We specialize in environments where failure is not an option, applying the rigor of the refit and rehabilitation sector for large vessels.

### 🎯 Our Mission
To rebuild European technical prestige in flooring systems, demonstrating that radical transparency and the symbiosis between manufacturing and application are the only ways to ensure the sector's survival in the 21st century.
