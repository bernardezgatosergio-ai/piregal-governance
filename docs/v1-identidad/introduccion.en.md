📘 PART I — STRATEGIC INTRODUCTION (English)
The current ecosystem of continuous flooring —and especially in the naval sector— is not merely under strain: it is undergoing a process of structural collapse [cite: 2026-02-18]. This is not due to a lack of technology or demand, but because of how manufacturers, intermediaries, and installers have chosen to relate to each other [cite: 2026-02-18].

For years, a segment of the chemical industry has attempted to parasitize the installer's margin, using its position as a manufacturer to invade the applicator's commercial space and erode their ability to survive [cite: 2026-02-18]. Simultaneously, a network of intermediaries, commission agents, and "favor managers" has contaminated the value chain with opaque practices that contribute nothing to technical quality or operational efficiency [cite: 2026-02-18].

In this environment, many installers have ended up disconnected from the technical and ethical reality required by a high-level project: systems are applied without prior audit, without environmental control, without traceability, and without assuming full responsibility for the result [cite: 2026-02-18]. The sector has become accustomed to working "as always," even though that "always" no longer works [cite: 2026-02-18].

The result is clear: failing decks, warranties that no one wants to honor, distrustful clients, and a market losing competitiveness year after year [cite: 2026-02-18].

The Real Threat
Europe no longer builds ships [cite: 2026-02-18]. The European naval market lives almost exclusively on rehabilitation and refit; even so, if the sector continues to operate with the same lack of rigor, transparency, and responsibility, even that residual market will not be guaranteed in the future [cite: 2026-02-18]. If we continue like this, we will not only stop building ships: we will also stop repairing many of them [cite: 2026-02-18].

The Paradigm Shift
The Piregal–Herculan B.V. alliance is born precisely as a frontal response to this decline [cite: 2026-02-18]. Not to compete within the current system, but to replace it entirely through a model that unites manufacturing and application under a single technical, ethical, and operational standard [cite: 2026-02-18].

From parasitism to a real technical bond [cite: 2026-02-18].

From opaque commissions to radical transparency [cite: 2026-02-18].

From improvisation to total traceability [cite: 2026-02-18].

From fragmentation to joint liability [cite: 2026-02-18].

From decline to the reconstruction of European technical prestige [cite: 2026-02-18].

Operational Symbiosis and Ethical Shield
Operational Symbiosis is not a slogan [cite: 2026-02-18]. It is a working model where manufacturer and installer stop being two separate entities to become a single technical system, with a single objective: to guarantee impeccable results in a market that no longer tolerates errors [cite: 2026-02-18].

This approach is articulated through the Ethical Shield, an integrity framework that protects the alliance from the practices that have degraded the sector: absurd commissions, manipulated specifications, installers without real training, manufacturers who disappear when a problem arises, and projects executed without audit or environmental control [cite: 2026-02-18].

This document describes how we will operate from today [cite: 2026-02-18].
