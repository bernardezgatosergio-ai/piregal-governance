# 📘 APPENDIX VIII — CODE OF ETHICS (SUMMARY)

The Summary Code of Ethics synthesizes the mandatory principles governing the **Piregal–Herculan** alliance. It is not a decorative document; it is a binding framework for all staff and collaborators, designed to protect technical and reputational integrity in a sector where ethics is often the exception.

### 1. INTEGRITY AND RADICAL TRANSPARENCY
* **Absolute Integrity:** Specifications are not manipulated, defects are not hidden, and measurements are not falsified. Integrity is a strategic asset [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Prohibition of Commissions:** Opaque commissions, payments to intermediaries without technical function, and informal "tolls" are prohibited. **Necessary Commission** is only allowed if managed by Piregal, communicated to Herculan, and duly documented [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Open Book Protocol:** We guarantee total transparency in prices, margins, and audits for VIP projects [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 2. OPERATIONAL COMMITMENT AND LOYALTY
* **Joint Liability:** This is an ethical commitment not to blame the partner, not to hide errors, and to resolve problems as a single technical organism [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Respect for Specification:** Piregal will not specify alternative brands, and Herculan will not support other installers in the Spanish naval cluster [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Compliance with Protocols:** No shortcuts are allowed in the Operational Protocol, PSAH, NCR, or ITP. Compliance is mandatory without exceptions [cite: 2026-02-18].

### 3. PROTECTION AND EXCELLENCE
* **Client Protection:** We guarantee verifiable quality and assume real responsibility; the client is never left unprotected [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Zero Tolerance for Negligence:** Applying outside environmental conditions or failing to record data in the ITP is considered a serious breach and incompatible with **Operational Symbiosis** [cite: 2026-02-18].
* **Legal and Environmental Compliance:** Absolute rigor with European and local regulations, including MARPOL waste management standards [cite: 2026-02-18].

**"We act as a single company."** This phrase summarizes our loyalty, rigor, and long-term vision [cite: 2026-02-18].
