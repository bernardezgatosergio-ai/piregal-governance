# 📎 APPENDIX I — OFFICIAL NOMENCLATURE GLOSSARY

This glossary establishes the common language of the Piregal–Herculan alliance, avoiding ambiguous interpretations, operational deviations, or technical discrepancies. The official nomenclature is part of the governance system and must be used in all documents, communications, audits, and meetings.

1. **PMEE — Strategic Expansion Master Plan:** The guiding document defining the strategy, philosophy, tactical actions, and expansion timeline of the alliance through 2026. It is the project's “operational bible.”
2. **PSAH — Synchrony and Milestone Audit Protocol:** A control system regulating monthly, quarterly, and semi-annual reviews. It ensures discipline, monitoring, and continuous correction.
3. **Operational Symbiosis:** A functional model where the manufacturer and installer operate as a single company, with joint liability, common standards, and shared objectives.
4. **Ethical Shield:** An integrity framework protecting the alliance from toxic industry practices: opaque commissions, technical manipulations, commercial interference, and lack of traceability.
5. **Vigo Hub:** Strategic logistical infrastructure ensuring permanent critical stock, 24/48h response, local tinting, and a base for international projects. It is the alliance's operational competitive advantage.
6. **Closed-Loop Warranty:** A joint warranty system where manufacturer and installer assume joint liability. It eliminates cross-blaming and protects the final client.
7. **Prior Technical Audit:** A mandatory process (laser scanning, moisture testing, suitability report) acting as an ethical and technical barrier to prevent structural failures.
8. **Notice of Readiness (NOR):** An area reception report signed with the shipyard certifying that the area is ready for work. It protects the installer and activates the shipyard's responsibility.
9. **Notice of Delay (NOD):** An official document issued when external factors (other trades, weather, shipyard non-compliance) delay the work, transferring legal responsibility to the shipyard.
10. **ITP — Inspection & Test Plan:** An inspection and testing plan documenting batches, environmental conditions, microns, and re-coating times. It is the mandatory digital traceability.
11. **Necessary Commission:** A controlled exception, managed by Piregal and communicated to Herculan, allowed only to unblock specific projects. Never opaque.
12. **Technical Intervention Team:** The official name of Piregal’s operational team. It reinforces their role as a technical commando, not a traditional trade.
13. **Critical Window:** The time period in which the application must be executed without interruptions to guarantee the system's chemical performance.
14. **Herculan Closed System:** A set of products (SL 300, SL 400, SL 500) and protocols that can only be applied under the alliance's standards.
15. **Open Book Protocol:** Total cost transparency in VIP or sensitive projects. A tool for trust and ethical differentiation.
