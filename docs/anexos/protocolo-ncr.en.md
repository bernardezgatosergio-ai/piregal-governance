# 📎 APPENDIX IV — NON-CONFORMANCE PROTOCOL (NCR)

The Non-Conformance Protocol (NCR) is a critical alliance tool. It is not an administrative document but a technical, contractual, and ethical protection instrument that shields the joint warranty and the alliance's reputation before the shipyard.

### 1. PROTOCOL OBJECTIVES
* **1.1. Warranty Protection:** If conditions are unfit, the warranty is automatically suspended.
* **1.2. Transfer of Liability:** Prevents the shipyard from blaming the alliance for failures due to moisture, third-party interference, or delays.
* **1.3. Technical Evidence:** Documentation through photographs and verifiable digital records.
* **1.4. Legal Shield:** Official document against unfounded claims.

### 2. ACTIVATION (WHEN TO ISSUE)
Issued whenever any condition compromises quality, safety, or compliance. Frequent reasons include:
* Substrate moisture exceeded or unfit dew point.
* Physical interference from other trades in the work area.
* Surface contamination or non-compliant substrate (cracks, delamination).
* Failure of the shipyard to meet the schedule.

### 3. ISSUANCE PROCEDURE (STEP-BY-STEP)
1. **Detection:** The Piregal technician identifies the risk and **halts the operation immediately**.
2. **Evidence Collection:** Recording photos, instrument readings, and laser scans.
3. **Issuance:** Use of the official template (Appendix III) with initial status: **OPEN**.
4. **Official Communication:** Formal delivery to the shipyard Project Manager, Site Management, and Herculan.
5. **Warranty Suspension:** Responsibility shifts to the shipyard; application does not resume.
6. **Corrective Action:** The shipyard must correct the cause and request re-inspection in writing.
7. **Closure:** After verifying the correction, the status is updated to **CLOSED**, and the warranty is reactivated in the ITP.

### 4. SEVERITY LEVELS
* **Type A — Critical:** Halts work (Moisture, Climate, Serious interference).
* **Type B — Important:** Requires mandatory correction before proceeding (Contamination, Lack of protection).
* **Type C — Informative:** Does not halt work but is recorded to protect the warranty (Minor damage, Aesthetic remarks).

### 5. RESPONSIBILITIES
* **Piregal:** Detects, documents, issues, communicates, and closes.
* **Herculan:** Technically validates and records in the warranty system.
* **Shipyard/Client:** Receives, corrects, requests re-inspection, and signs the closure.
