# 📎 APPENDIX II — JOINT LIABILITY MATRIX

Joint Liability is the legal and operational core that sets the Piregal–Herculan alliance apart. It is a binding contractual commitment that eliminates cross-blaming, protects the end client, and mandates both parties to operate under maximum standards.

### 1. GENERAL PRINCIPLE
Piregal and Herculan jointly assume responsibility for the final result of any project executed under the **Herculan Closed System**. The alliance acts as a single point of contact; the client is never trapped between manufacturer and installer.
